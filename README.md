# Summary
Thank you for take a look at my GitHub profile. This page is a summary of all the projects I did while in the university. Enjoy !

## Project
### Empower-Crowdsourcing-with-Blockchain
**Main features:**

* Create vote and send transaction to Blockchain 
* Smart contract calculates reward ERC20 tokens
* Smart contract keeps track of terminated news
* Applies the concept of Proof-of-stake to calculate incentivized tokens and prevent spammers
* Designs Off-chain storage that stores data on MongoDB to reduce the cost and query time.

**Languages**: Solidity, JavaScript, Python

**Frameworks**: Web3, MongoDB, Keras

**GitHub**: [Crowdsourcing with Blockchain](https://github.com/pdmquang/Empower-Crowdsourcing-with-Blockchain)

**Research**: `Use of Blockchain and Ethereum to create fake news
detection model`

### Build Project from Scratch
A collection of implementations where I recreate key algorithms and systems from the ground up to deeply understand their internal workings.

* **Purpose:** Learn by doing — no black boxes. I rebuilt core systems to uncover how they really work under the hood.

**Projects Included:**

* **Decision Tree Classifier**: Implemented Decision Tree from scratch, including Gini index.
* **GitHub (Version Control)**: Built a simplified Git clone using Python, following the internal object model (blobs, trees, commits).

* **Pytorch implementation:** Feedforward Neural Network, CNN, RNN

* **Frameworks Used:** Pytorch, Numpy, Pandas  

* **Learning Outcomes:**
    * Strengthened intuition for how ML models work internally — no libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch used
    * Gained hands-on understanding of Git internals (e.g., SHA hashing, tree objects, staging)
    * Practiced memory efficiency, matrix operations, and numerical stability

* **GitHub:** [Build-X-From-Scratch](https://github.com/pdmquang/Build-X-From-Scratch)
